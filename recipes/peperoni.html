    <h1>Pepperoni in a Blanket</h1>

    <img src="../images/peporoni.jpg" alt="Pepperoni">

    <p>TFor these pepperoni pigs in a blanket, cocktail franks are wrapped twice—first in a slice of pepperoni, and then in ready-to-bake crescent roll dough, and baked until deeply golden brown. Even a regular cocktail frank wrapped in pastry is a wonderful thing to eat, but the pepperoni adds lots of flavor and texture—those crispy edges elevate the experience even more.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) can ready-to-bake crescent roll dough</li>
        <li>48 cocktail franks or other mini smoked sausages (about 1 pound)</li>
        <li>48 thin slices pepperoni (about 4 ounces)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment.</li>
        <li>Separate crescent roll dough into 8 triangles, and place on the prepared sheet pan. Pop the pan into the freezer to firm up dough, about 10 minutes; it will be easier to cut and work with.</li>
        <li>Start with the longest and straightest side of a dough triangle, and cut 3 strips about 1-inch wide using a pizza cutter or sharp knife; then cut each strip into approximately 2-inch lengths. To make 48 pigs in a blanket you’ll need to get 6 wrappable pieces from each triangle of dough. Press small end pieces and trimmings together as needed to create more 2-inch strips. If dough gets too warm and soft during the process, stop and return it to the freezer for a few minutes to firm up.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Wrap a cocktail frank with a piece of pepperoni, and place on one end of a dough strip. Roll up, finishing with the seam on the bottom. Repeat with remining ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
