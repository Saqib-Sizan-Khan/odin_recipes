    <h1>Brown Butter Oatmeal Sandwich Cookies</h1>

    <img src="../images/cookies.jpg" alt="Cookies">

    <p>These brown butter oatmeal sandwich cookies prove 
        that brown butter makes everything taste betterâ€”they 
        are extra rich and delicious. Pairs of warmly-spiced 
        oatmeal cookies are filled with a sweet vanilla cream 
        cheese filling. If you don't have dark corn syrup, 
        you can swap it out with light corn syrup, molasses, 
        maple syrup, or even honey.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dark corn syrup</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place butter in a light colored saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until butter has browned and begins to smell nutty, 7 to 10 minutes. Measure out 1/2 cup browned butter and pour into a large mixing bowl to cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve remaining browned butter (1/4 to 1/3 cup) for the filling.</li>
        <li>Stir brown sugar and corn syrup into the bowl with cooled brown butter until thoroughly combined; stir in egg and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Add in oats, flour, cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon salt, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, and allspice and stir until combined.</li>
        <li>Scoop out 2 tablespoons of dough and carefully roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining dough. Place dough balls into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place chilled balls of dough about 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets (about 6 dough balls per pan). Bake one pan at a time until cookies begin to turn golden brown on the edges, 10 to 11 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
